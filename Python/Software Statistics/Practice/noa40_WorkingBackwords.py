# A 95% confidence interval for a population mean, u, is given as (18.985, 21.015). 
# This confidence interval is based on a simple random samples of 36 observations. 
# Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.
#  Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.
#  Use the t-distribution in any calculations.
# Output:[mean, standard deviation], accurate to the second decimal place
