# Georgianna claims that in a small city renowned for its music school, the average child takes at least 5 years of piano lessons. 
# We have a random sample of 20 children from the city with a mean of 4.6 years of piano lessons
#  and a standard deviation of 2.2 years. Evaluate Georgianna's claims using a hypothesis test.
#   alpha is 0.05. 
# Extra:
# (1) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the number of years students in this city takes piano lessons and interpret it in context of the data.
# (2) Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree? Explain your reasoning.

# [degree-of-freedom-of-distribution, statistical values, conclusion],
# 'degree-of-freedom-of-distribution' and 'statistical values' are accurate to the second decimal place, 
# 'conclusion' is True, which means the H0 is accepted, or False
