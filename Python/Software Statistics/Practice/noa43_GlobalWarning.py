# Is there strong evidence of global warming? 
# Let's consider a small scale example, comparing how temperatures have changed is the US from 1968 to 2008. 
# The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected in 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the continental US. 
# Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated 
# for each of the 51 values was 1.1 degree with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. 
# We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.
# (1) Is there a relationship between the observations collected in 1968 and 2008? Or are the observations in the two groups independent? Explain
# (2) What's the hypothesis for this research?
# (3) Check the conditions required to complete this test.
# (4) Calculate the freedom, test statistical value and give the conclusion. alpha is 0.05, coding this part
# (5) What type of error might we have made?
# (6) Based on the results of this hypothesis test, would you expect a confidence interval for the average difference between the temperature measurements from 1968 and 2008 to include 0? Explain

# [degree-of-freedom-of-distribution, statistical values, conclusion],'degree-of-freedom-of-distribution' and 'statistical values' are accurate to the second decimal place, 'conclusion' is True, which means the H0 is accepted, or False
