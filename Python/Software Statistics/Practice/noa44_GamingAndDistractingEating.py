# A group of researchers are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, 
# such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption. 
# To test this hypothesis, they monitored food in take for a group of 44 patients who were randomised into two equal groups.
#  The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions.
#   Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, 
#   and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams.
#    Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average food intake is different for the patients in the treatment group? 
#    Assume the conditions for inference are satisfied.
# Null hypothesis is H0: u_t - u_c = 0, alpha is 0.05
