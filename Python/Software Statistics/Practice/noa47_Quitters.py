# Does being part of a support group affect the ability of people to quit smoking?
#  A country health department enrolled 300 smokers in a randomized experiment. 
#  150 participants were assigned to a group that used a nicotine patch and met weekly with a support group;
#   the other 150 received the patch and did not meet with a support group. At the end of the study, 
#   40 of the participants in the patch plus support group had quit smoking while only 30 smokers had quit in the other group.
# (1) Create a two-way table presenting the results of this study.
# (2) Answer each of the following questions under the null hypothesis that being part of a support group does not affect the ability of people to quit smoking, and indicate whether the expected values are higher or lower than the observed values.
#      * How many subjects in the "patch+support" group would you expect to quit? coding this part
#      * How many subjects in the "patch only" group would you expect to not quit?
