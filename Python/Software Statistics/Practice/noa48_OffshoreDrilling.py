# The table below summaries a data set that examines the response of a random sample of college graduates
#  and non-graduate on the topic of oil drilling. Complete a chi-square test for test data to check 
#  whether there is a statistically significant difference in responses from college graduates and non-graduates.

# College Grad?    Yes    No    Total
# Support    154    132    286
# Oppose    180    126    306
# Do not know    104    131    235
# Total    438    389    827

# [degree-of-freedom-of-distribution, statistical values, conclusion],'degree-of-freedom-of-distribution' and 'statistical values' are accurate to the second decimal place, 'conclusion' is True, which means the H0 is accepted, or False
